## 🛠️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `VITE_R2_JSON_URL` | URL (or comma-separated list) to your primary JSON data source(s) | `https://pub-xxx.r2.dev/data/listings.json` |
| `VITE_SECONDARY_JSON_URL` | Optional secondary feed URL(s) for enrichment | `https://example.com/secondary.json` |

### Data Format

The application expects JSON data with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 16561498,
    "title_en": "Ford Fiesta 2012 GCC",
    "price": 5700,
    "city_inferred": "Dubai",
    "details_make": "Ford",
    "details_model": "Fiesta",
    "location_path": ["Dubai", "Deira"],
    "neighbourhood_en": "Al Safa 2",
    "details_body_type": "Hatchback",
    "details_year": 2012,
    "details_kilometers": 220000,
    "details_transmission_type": "Automatic Transmission",
    "details_regional_specs": "GCC Specs",
    "details_seller_type": "Dealer",
    "has_phone_number": true,
    "has_whatsapp_number": true,
    "permalink": "https://example.com/s/DOBH4Yw",
    "url": "https://example.com/listings/ford-fiesta-2012-123456",
    "added_epoch_iso": "2025-09-16T12:48:59+00:00",
    "created_at_epoch_iso": "2025-09-16T12:49:36+00:00"
  }
]
```

Secondary feeds exposed through `VITE_SECONDARY_JSON_URL` may expose listings using a slightly different schema (for example `detail_*` fields) or as newline-delimited JSON without wrapping them in an array. The loader automatically normalizes these shapes — including expanding mileage units such as `KMT` into kilometres — so you can mix and match feeds without additional preprocessing.

### Field mapping

- `brand` is sourced from `details_make` (with fallbacks for similarly named keys).
- `model` reads from `details_model`/`details_model_trim` and related keys without relying on `title_en`.
- `location_full` is rendered from the richest available location hierarchy (`location_path`, `location_full`, etc.) and falls back to `city_inferred` + `neighbourhood_en` when present.
- The listings table surfaces `details_make`, `details_model`, `neighbourhood_en`, `details_regional_specs`, and `details_seller_type` directly for clarity.

### Multiple source feeds

- Both `VITE_R2_JSON_URL` and `VITE_SECONDARY_JSON_URL` accept either a single URL or a comma/newline-delimited list of URLs. Arrays expressed as JSON (`["https://…", "https://…"]`) are also supported.
- Additional feeds can be injected at runtime with `window.__R2_JSON_URL__` or `window.__SECONDARY_JSON_URL__` before the app boots.
- The Admin console surfaces freshness, coverage, and trimmed price averages for each configured source so you can quickly validate ingestion health.

### Testing

- **Unit tests** cover helpers (including outlier-resistant averages and data loaders) plus interactive primitives like the intelligent search multi-select.
- **Integration tests** exercise end-to-end analytics workflows, including widget filters, grouped tables, chart previews, and the new admin console experience.
- Execute the full suite with `npm test`. Use `npm run test:watch` during development for rapid feedback.

### Data quality
- Listing-level averages now use robust statistical trimming to exclude anomalous prices before computing market benchmarks.
- The Admin console reports how many outliers were trimmed per source so data issues can be investigated quickly.

### Code Quality
- ESLint configuration for code consistency
- Prettier for code formatting
- Responsive design testing
- Cross-browser compatibility
